		<h2>Rugby Tournament in SD</h2>

		<p>
			My hobbies include lifting weights, video games, soccer, and rugby.
			I played on the university soccer team for my first 2 years, and had to
			quit due to family stuff. I play on the UNO Rugby team now to fill the pasison
			I have for sports. However, I am currently 5 months post knee surgery;
			and	I am working my way back to playing.
